    "# Integration Test of CLIMADA Impact Assessment with Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) data (V3)\n",
    "\n",
    "### About\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to this tutorial, where we embark on a journey to analyse the impact of heat stress using CLIMADA in the context of the U-CLIMADAPT project (User-centric Assessment of Climate Change Impacts for Adaptation). This tutorial is part of a series of four, focusing on **01 Installation and Data Access**, **02 Warm-up**, **03 Scenario**, and **04 Uncertainty and Sensitivity**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beginning with **01 Installation and Data Access**, it is essential to fully utilise this tutorial series, as it lays the foundation for the entire workflow. This first tutorial ensures that all necessary software, dependencies, and data access are correctly set up, enabling seamless execution of the remaining tutorials.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the other tutorials (02 Warm-up, 03 Scenario, and 04 Uncertainty and Sensitivity) are designed to be self-contained. You can approach them independently based on your familiarity and expertise with handling CDS data and working with CLIMADA. \n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout these tutorials, we will demonstrate how we leverage climate data, particularly seasonal forecast data from the Climate Data Store (CDS) of the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), in conjunction with CLIMADA (CLIMate ADAptation), to estimate the socio-economic or human impacts of climate-related hazards.\n",
    "\n",
    "### About U-CLIMADAPT\n",
    "\n",
    "The U-CLIMADAPT project is a collaborative effort led by the Working Group \"Impact of Climate Change.\" Its primary goal is to provide refined climate impact assessments tailored to specific requirements. To achieve this, it leverages the power of climate forecasts and projections from C3S's Climate Data Store (CDS) while integrating Copernicus land-use and satellite data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integrating CLIMADA and Copernicus Data\n",
    "\n",
    "U-CLIMADAPT integrates Copernicus Climate Data Store (CDS) datasets with CLIMADA to create a powerful tool for assessing the socioeconomic impacts of climate hazards. By combining Copernicus data on extreme heat, floods, drought, and more with CLIMADA’s modelling capabilities, users can estimate risks to populations, infrastructure, and assets, enabling data-driven climate adaptation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Tutorial Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's dive into the tutorial itself. We will guide you through the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install CLIMADA ETH.\n",
    "- Search for and download Copernicus data from the Copernicus Data Store CDS.\n",
    "\n",
    "By following this tutorial, you will gain hands-on experience and unlock the potential of integrating CLIMADA with C3S data from Copernicus. Let's get started!"
