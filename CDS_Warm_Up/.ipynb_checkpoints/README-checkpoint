    Saving Analysis Results: Guidance on how to save the results of the analysis in both tabular and spatial formats for further use.

"Functions"

Within the context of this project, specialized functions have been developed to assist users in exporting their findings, particularly the Annual Expected Impact (AEI). AEI refers to the anticipated impact in an average year for each exposure point, available in NetCDF or GeoTIFF formats. This feature is particularly beneficial for integrating CLIMADA's outcomes with other geospatial platforms or software for extended analysis. Moreover, these functionalities facilitate quicker and more straightforward visual communication of the results.

This exercise aims to equip users with the necessary skills to navigate, utilize, and analyze Copernicus data effectively within the CLIMADA ETH framework. By engaging with this guide, users will be prepared to conduct comprehensive impact analyses and communicate their findings efficiently.

"Data Description"

__Heatwave Hazard Analysis in Europe__

Objective: In this first exercise, our goal is to analyze the heatwave hazard in Europe using the heatwave days dataset from Copernicus. This dataset is instrumental in understanding the potential heatwave impacts on the region, informed by climate change projections.
Dataset Overview

    Source: Copernicus
    Climate Scenarios: RCP 8.5 and RCP 4.5, representing different greenhouse gas concentration trajectories.
    Data Type: Bias-adjusted EURO-CORDEX dataset.
    Temporal Coverage: 1971 to 2100.
    Analysis Period: Averaging statistics over 30-year intervals for a smooth mean time series spanning 1986 to 2085.
    Resolution: 0.1Â° in latitude and longitude, approximately equivalent to 11 kilometers at the equator.

__Exposure Data__

Following the hazard identification, we will develop the exposure dataset. Exposure refers to assets, individuals, infrastructure, and other elements within a specified area that are susceptible to hazards, inclusive of their geographical coordinates, values, and additional relevant details.
CLIMADA's Ready-to-Use Data: LitPop

    Description: LitPop is a pre-existing exposure dataset provided by CLIMADA, integrating estimates of asset value, economic activity, or population based on nightlight intensity and population count data.

External Exposure Data: Custom Dataset Creation

Objective: To create a custom exposure dataset, we will download and merge population data for Switzerland and Germany for the year 2020, offering data at 1 km resolution.
Steps to Create Exposure Data:

    Data Source: Access the Worldpop website (worldpop.org) or a specific data repository designated for population data.
    Data Selection: Locate and download the population data for Switzerland and Germany at 1 km resolution for 2020.
    Format: Ensure the data is in a format that aligns with your analytical or processing needs (e.g., raster file format).
